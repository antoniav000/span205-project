            <p>This traditional Mexican dress, known as a "Tehuana dress," is a vibrant and culturally significant 
            garment originating from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. The dress is characterized 
            by its elaborate and colorful design, featuring a richly embroidered huipil (blouse) adorned with intricate 
            floral patterns and geometric motifs.</p>
            <p>The skirt, or "enagua," is made from layers of fabric, often with a lace-trimmed hem, creating a voluminous 
                and elegant silhouette. The bright yellow and red hues of the blouse contrast beautifully with the dark, 
                patterned skirt, reflecting the joy and vitality of Mexican heritage. This attire is traditionally worn 
                during festivals, ceremonies, and dance performances, symbolizing pride in indigenous roots and the vibrant 
                cultural tapestry of Mexico.</p>
