            <p1>This traditional Mexican dress, known as a "Tehuana dress," is a  garment originating from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 
                in the state of Oaxaca. The dress is characterized by its colorful design, featuring an embroidered huipil (blouse) 
                adorned with floral patterns.</p1>
            <p2>The skirt, or "enagua," is made from layers of fabric, often with a lace-trimmed hem. The brighter hues of the blouse 
                stand out in comparison with the dark, patterned skirt, creating a striking contrast. This attire is traditionally worn 
                during festivals, ceremonies, and dance performances, symbolizing pride in indigenous roots and the cultural tapestry of Mexico.</p2>

                Brooch, and the No. 214 Mandolin Lace Pin or Brooch, priced at 85 cents to $1.35 and 75 cents to $1.25, respectively. 
                Because of monarch butterflies' cultural significance in Mexico (they travel and nest in the country), the butterfly is
                a common symbol in Mexican art. The No. 215 Butterfly Lace Pin or Brooch, is available in three sizes and priced 
                from $1.00 to $1.50.</p3>

            <p3>Embroidered Mexican shirts, known for their intricate designs and bright colors, are another expression of the country’s 
                cultural heritage and artisanal craftsmanship. These shirts, often referred to as "huipiles" for women or "guayaberas" 
                for men, feature hand-stitched patterns inspired from indigenous traditions. The embroidery typically includes floral designs, 
                geometric patterns, or symbolic imagery. The threads used in the embroidery generally contrast with the fabric, usually made from 
                cotton or linen, creating garments that are not only visually appealing but also comfortable and breathable.</p3>

            <p3>Mexican shawls, known as "rebozos," are a quintessential symbol of the country’s cultural heritage and artisanal excellence. 
                These garments are handwoven using traditional techniques passed down through generations using looms. The rebozos are celebrated 
                for their various patterns and colors, which vary significantly from one region to another, and they can be made from a range of materials, 
                including cotton, wool, and silk, these shawls are both functional and decorative. They can be used for warmth, as a head covering, or as a 
                stylish accessory draped over the shoulders. In Mexican indigenous communities, there are still many people who wear these shawls.</p3>

            <p3>Sombreros are one of the most recognizable symbols of Mexican culture, embodying the country’s rich heritage and vibrant traditions. 
                These wide-brimmed hats, designed to provide protection from the sun, are often made from materials like straw or felt and are adorned with 
                embroidery, colorful ribbons, or bands. The sombrero’s design varies depending its use and purpose. For example, some are worn by charros (Mexican cowboys) and 
                and others by mariachis. </p3>

            <p3>A classic look in traditional Mexican men’s attire features a plain white guayabera shirt paired with boots. The guayabera, made of cotton or linen,
